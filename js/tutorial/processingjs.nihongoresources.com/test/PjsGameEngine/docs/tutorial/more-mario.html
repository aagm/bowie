    <h1>Let's refine our Mario game.</h1>
    
    <p>In the previous tutorial we made a Mario game. And it was awesome. Now it's
    time to visit some more advanced topics when it comes to games, and we'll
    introduce all of them as Mario game mechanics. This tutorial will cover the
    following things:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>teleporting</li>
      <li>moving between layers</li>
      <li>level swapping</li>
      <li>player powers</li>
      <li>decorations (decals)</li>
      <li>Animation trajectories and paths</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Teleporting</h2>
    
    <p>Let's start off by implementing teleporting. The concept is pretty straight
    forward:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>listen for a specific event to cause a teleport</li>
      <li>call <code>actor.setPosition(...,...)</code> to effect a teleport</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>There are many ways in which to listen for teleport events,
    including using a teleport <code>Pickup</code>, a teleport <code>Trigger</code>
    region, or that old favourite: an actual teleporter. So let's implement one
    of those, to get a feel for the whole thing. First we extend our previous
    tutorial's Mario with a "crouching" state when you press 'S', so that we have
    something to monitor for teleporting, and then we'll set up our actual teleport.</p>

class Mario extends Player {
  [...]

  Mario() {
    super("Mario");
    setStates();
    handleKey('W');
    handleKey('A');
    handleKey('S');
    handleKey('D');
    setImpulseCoefficients(DAMPENING, DAMPENING);
    setForces(0, DOWN_FORCE);
    setAcceleration(0, ACCELERATION);
  }

  // We want ot make sure all states are center/bottom anchored,
  // so that when we switch from normal to crouch and back, the
  // sprite will always be anchored to the floor.
  void addState(State st) {
    st.sprite.anchor(CENTER, BOTTOM);
    super.addState(st);
  }  
  
  // the same as before, but now with crouch and crouchjump
  void setStates() {
    addState(new State("idle", "graphics/mario/small/Standing-mario.gif"));
    addState(new State("crouching", "graphics/mario/small/Crouching-mario.gif"));
    addState(new State("running", "graphics/mario/small/Running-mario.gif", 1, 4));
    
    State jumping = new State("jumping", "graphics/mario/small/Jumping-mario.gif");
    jumping.setDuration(15);
    addState(jumping);
    SoundManager.load(jumping, "audio/Jump.mp3");

  void handleStateFinished(State which) {

  // We add in handling of the 'S' key, too

      if (active.name=="jumping") { setCurrentState("crouchjumping"); }
      else { setCurrentState("crouching"); }
    }

    if (active.mayChange()) {
      // and finally, make sure we don't run if we're crouching
      if (active.name!="crouching" && (isKeyDown('A') || isKeyDown('D'))) {
        setCurrentState("running");
      }
      else if (noKeysDown()) { setCurrentState("idle"); }
    }
  }

    <p>Alright, that's a fair bit of code, but you should be able to 
    see what's going on at this point. Two new states have been introduced,
    the crouch and crouch-jump states, and they require input handling to
    be extended so that we can change to them, and don't change away from
    them when we shouldn't reasonably be able to.</p>
    
    <p>So let's make a teleporter.</p>

    <figure>
      <img src="graphics/assorted/Teleporter.gif" alt="a teleporter">
       <figcaption>Something like this</figcaption>
    </figure>     
    
    <p>You might recognise that as a Megaman (or Rockman if you prefer)
    teleporter. Super convenient! we're going to turn this into an in-game
    teleporter by setting up the following:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>an Interactor that uses the teleporter sprite for its idle state</li>
      <li>a special boundary that can listen to what attached actors are doing</li>
      <li>a one-way binding to another teleporter</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>With this, we'll have a simple teleport procedure: actor jumps onto teleporter,
    actor crouches, teleporter teleports actor to its new location. So, let's make
    a teleporter; we make it a <code>BoundedInteractor</code>, just like we did with
    the <code>Muncher</code> in the previous tutorial, because we need to attach
    boundaries to this things:</p>

<textarea>
class Teleporter extends BoundedInteractor {
  TeleportBoundary surface;
  
  Teleporter(float x, float y) {
    super("Teleporter");
    setPosition(x,y);

    // set up the idle state with our teleporter image:
    State idle = new State("idle","graphics/assorted/Teleporter.gif");
    idle.sprite.align(CENTER,BOTTOM);
    addState(idle);

    // add a ceiling boundary so we don't jump through
    // the teleporter if we're standing on it:
    addBoundary(new Boundary(x+16,y-48,x-16,y-48));

    // add the active teleporter surface
    surface = new TeleportBoundary(x-16,y-16,x+16,y-16);
    addBoundary(surface);    
  }

  // Which other teleporter should we teleport actors to?
  void teleportTo(Teleporter other) {
    surface.setTeleportLocation(other.x, other.y-32);
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>Alright, done. Of course we need to define this special
    "Teleporter Boundary" too:</p>

<textarea>
class TeleportBoundary extends Boundary {
  float teleport_location_x=0, teleport_location_y=0;

  TeleportBoundary(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2) {
    super(x1,y1,x2,y2);   
    teleport_location_x = (x1+x2)/2;
    teleport_location_y = (y1+y2)/2;
    // set up the "plop" sound for playing when we teleport
    SoundManager.load(this,"audio/Squish.mp3");
  }
  
  // where should this teleport surface teleport actors to?
  void setTeleportLocation(float x, float y) {
    teleport_location_x = x;
    teleport_location_y = y;
  }
  
  // Teleport an actor to the predefined coordinates!
  void teleport(Actor a) {
    a.setPosition(teleport_location_x,teleport_location_y);
  }

  // when we teleport an actor, it should get a zero-impulse
  float[] STATIONARY = {0,0};
   
  // keeps Processing.js happy
  float[] redirectForce(float fx, float fy) {
    return super.redirectForce(fx,fy);
  }

  // teleport based on what the actor is doing
  float[] redirectForce(Actor a, float fx, float fy) {
    if(a.active.name=="crouching") {
      a.detachFrom(this);
      a.setCurrentState("idle");
      teleport(a);
      SoundManager.play(this);
      return STATIONARY;
    }
    else { return super.redirectForce(a,fx,fy); }
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>The important bits happen on lines 22 through 38, and specifically
    on lines 30 through 38: we "intercept" the function that is normally
    used to determine how to update an actor position. When an actor is
    moving around freely, this is isolated code and we can't see what's
    happening, but when an actor is standing on a boundary, the boundary
    is asked whether the intended motion of the actor is "legal" or not,
    and if it's illegal, how it should be changed to make it legal.</p>
    
    <p>For instance, an actor standing on an incline, while subjected to
    gravity, would LIKE to fall straight through the incline, because
    gravity points straight down, but this would be illegal movement.
    Instead, the incline will change the illegal movement into legal
    movement along the surface of the incline, so we slide left or
    right, rather than going straight through. This happens in the
    <code>redirectForce</code> function, so we can hijack that in order
    to make teleportation happen.</p>
    
    <p>This function is called every frame as long as an actor is
    standing on a boundary, so what we do is check: "is the actor
    crouching? If so, it's teleport time! ... if not, just let
    the normal code for force redirecting do its thing", which
    you see on line 37. You may also see that lines 25, 26, and 27
    don't seem to do anything - they just immediately call
    the superclass's function. This is mostly to appease Processing.js,
    which (thanks to JavaScript and Processing being slightly different
    in how they deal with super/sub classing) makes everything work.
    Without them, the call on line 37 will actually call the function
    on line 30, which would be very inconvenient.</p>
    
    <p>Anyway, back to what our code does: when an actor crouches,
    we detach it from the boundary, set its state to idle instead
    of crouching, and then teleport them to their new location.
    <code>return STATIONARY</code> on line 35 is required because
    the <code>redirectForce</code> must always return a list of
    numbers that represent the new x and y directions of an actor's
    intended movement. Even if we don't want them to move, we have
    to explicitly say this, so we return the list "no movement in the
    x direction, and no movement in the y direction", which we've
    stored in a variable called <code>STATIONARY</code> on line 22.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, we want to actually make use of these teleporters.
    So let's take our original <code>LevelLayer</code> and strip
    out everything except the ground, and add some teleporters
    (for testing purposes, we're going to make the level layer
    only one screen size wide and height):</p>
    
<textarea>
class MainLevelLayer extends LevelLayer {
  Mario mario;
  
  MainLevelLayer(Level owner) {
    super(owner);
    addBackgroundSprite(new TilingSprite(new Sprite("graphics/backgrounds/sky.gif"),0,0,width,height));

    // set up Mario!
    mario = new Mario();
    mario.setPosition(32, height-64);
    addPlayer(mario);

    // we don't want mario to walk off the level, so we keep the side walls
    addBoundary(new Boundary(-1,0, -1,height));
    addBoundary(new Boundary(width+1,height, width+1,0));

    // the ground now has an unjumpable gap:
    addGround("ground", -32,height-48, width/2-96,height);
    addGround("ground", width/2 + 49,height-48, width+32,height);

    // then, add two teleporters on either side of the gap
    Teleporter t1 = addTeleporter(width/4+20, height-48);
    Teleporter t2 = addTeleporter(3*width/4-68, height-48);

    // and we link them together, so they teleport to each other
    t1.teleportTo(t2);
    t2.teleportTo(t1);
  }

  // for convenience we change the draw function
  // so that if Mario falls outside the screen,
  // we put him back at his start position:
  void draw() {
    super.draw();
    if(mario.y>height+64) { mario.setPosition(32,height-64); }
  }

  // Add a teleporter to the scene, and make sure to give
  // back a reference to it so that we can use that to link
  // up two (or more!) teleporters.
  Teleporter addTeleporter(float x, float y) {
    Teleporter t = new Teleporter(x, y);
    addBoundedInteractor(t);
    return t;
  }
  
  // same function as before
  void addGround(String tileset, float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2) {
    [...]
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>Alright, cool. We now have a level with teleporters. Let's try this out!
    We should now be able to jump onto a teleporter, press 'S', and teleport
    across the gaping canyon in the level. We should also able to just
    walk off the cliff, although that won't do us much good to get the other
    side...=D</p>

      <canvas data-processing-sources="codebase.pde preloads.pde sketches/refined/sketch01.pde"></canvas>
       <figcaption>Canyons mean nothing to us</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>Niiiice... but not very Mario. You've seen the idea behind teleporting,
    so let's take what we know, and apply it to the only possibly correct
    Mario teleporter: green, tubish, pipe-like "brrp-brrp-brrp" teleporters!</p>
    
    <figure>
      <div class="imageblock">
        <img src="graphics/assorted/Pipe-head.gif" alt="a pipe head">
        <img src="graphics/assorted/Pipe-body.gif" alt="a pipe">
      </div>
      <figcaption>You know the ones I'm talking about</figcaption>
    </figure>  
    
    <p>We're going to use the same idea, but work it out slightly different:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>two-part pipe: head and body, drawn as foreground objects</li>
      <li>five boundaries: four around the pipe, and a fifth one at the bottom of the head</li>
      <li>the top boundary will listen for 'S' and disable itself</li>
      <li>this will make us fall 'into' the pipe!</li>
      <li>where we'll have a trigger region set up to teleport us!!</li>
      <li>which not only teleports mario to inside another tube, but gives him an upward force, so he'll pop out!!!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>There is nothing in this plan that isn't going to work. Let's get to it:</p>

<textarea>
class MainLevelLayer extends LevelLayer {
  Mario mario;
  
  MainLevelLayer(Level owner) {
    [...]

    // add two teleporters on either side of the gap
    Pipe t1 = addPipe(width/4-16, height-48);
    Pipe t2 = addPipe(3*width/4-64, height-48);

    // and link them together
    t1.teleportTo(t2);
    t2.teleportTo(t1);
  }

  [...]

  /**
   * Add a teleporter pipe
   */
  Pipe addPipe(float x, float y) {
    Pipe p = new Pipe(x, y);
    addBoundedInteractor(p);
    addForegroundSprite(p.head);
    addForegroundSprite(p.body);
    addTrigger(p.trigger);
    return p;
  }
  
  [...]
}
</textarea>

    <p>Of course, we'll need to actually define this pipe class, too:</p>

<textarea>
class Pipe extends BoundedInteractor {
  Lid lid;
  Sprite head, body;
  TeleportTrigger trigger;
  
  Pipe(float x, float y) {
    super("Teleporter");
    setPosition(x,y);

    // set up the sprite graphics
    head = new Sprite("graphics/assorted/Pipe-head.gif");
    head.align(LEFT,BOTTOM);
    head.setPosition(x,y-16);
    body = new Sprite("graphics/assorted/Pipe-body.gif");
    body.align(LEFT,BOTTOM);
    body.setPosition(x,y);
    
    // add the five boundaries, of which the top is a special "lid" boundary
    lid = new Lid(x,y-48, x+32,y-48);
    addBoundary(lid);
    addBoundary(new Boundary(x+32,y-48, x+32,y));
    addBoundary(new Boundary(x+32,y, x,y));
    addBoundary(new Boundary(x,y, x,y-48));

    // a hidden boundery inside the pipe, so we don't fall through
    addBoundary(new Boundary(x,y-8, x+32,y-8));

    // and set up our teleport trigger
    trigger = new TeleportTrigger(x+2,y-10,28,2);
    trigger.setLid(lid);
  }

  void teleportTo(Pipe other) {
    trigger.setDestination(other.x+16, other.y-24);
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>We do a few things here. First off, we reserve <code>head</code>, <code>body</code>,
    and <code>trigger</code> as properties that we can call from somewhere else, like the 
    Level Layer that we create the pipe in. Because the two sprites and the trigger need
    to be added to a layer, we make them accessible.</p>
    
    <p>Then, in the constructor, we set up the head and body as simple sprites. To make
    positioning easier, we also align them so that if we position them on (x,y), that
    will be their left/bottom corner, using <code>align(LEFT,BOTTOM)</code>.</p>
    
    <p>After that we add the boundaries. We box in the pipe, and add another boundary
    inside the pipe so that we can't "fall through" the pipe if we're inside it. This
    is important, because we're going to be inside it when we teleport!</p>
    
    <p>The teleporting we effect by adding a trigger region that lives inside the pipe,
    so that when something falls through the lid (when that gets disabled), they fall onto
    the trigger region, and get teleported.</p>
    
    <p>So far, so good! Now, the <code>Lid</code> and <code>TeleportTrigger</code> look
    as follows:</p>

<textarea>
class Lid extends Boundary {
  Lid(float x1, float y1, float x2, float y2) {
    super(x1,y1,x2,y2);
  }

  // when we teleport an actor, it should get a zero-impulse
  float[] STATIONARY = {0,0};
   
  // keeps Processing.js happy
  float[] redirectForce(float fx, float fy) {
    return super.redirectForce(fx,fy);
  }

  // teleport based on what the actor is doing
  float[] redirectForce(Actor a, float fx, float fy) {
    if(a.active.name=="crouching") {
      disable();
    }
    return super.redirectForce(a,fx,fy);
  }
}
</textarea>

    <p>This is similar to the previous teleport boundary, except
    that we don't immediately teleport any actors, we simply
    disable the boundary, so they'll fall through, and hit the
    teleport trigger - sneakily hidden behind the pipe's graphics:</p>

<textarea>
class TeleportTrigger extends Trigger {
  Lid lid;
  float teleport_x, teleport_y;
  
  // we build a trigger with the classic "brrp brrp brrp" sound
  TeleportTrigger(float x, float y, float w, float h) {
    super("Teleporter",x,y,w,h);
    SoundManager.load(this, "audio/Pipe.mp3");
  }
  
  // we'll need to enable the pipe lid when we teleport
  void setLid(Lid l) { lid = l; }
  
  // we'll also need to know WHERE to teleport to =)
  void setDestination(float x, float y) {
    teleport_x = x;
    teleport_y = y;
  }
  
  // when the trigger is activated...
  void run(LevelLayer level, Actor actor, float[] intersection) {
    //... enable the lid again, so it's a real boundary again,
    lid.enable();
    // and teleport the actor,
    actor.setPosition(teleport_x,teleport_y);
    // and give it an upward jump, 
    actor.setImpulse(0,-30);
    // and play the brrp brrp brrp sound!
    SoundManager.play(this);
  }
}
</textarea>    

    <p>So what does this look like? Well, to show this off best, let's
    look at this in two different ways. One with boundaries and triggers
    shown (in debug mode) without drawing the pipe graphics, and one
    in "game view", where we just see the graphics, with boundaries and
    triggers hidden:</p>
